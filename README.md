## Research

### Databases
(PostgreSQL)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Fluyr3lbc]

### Microservices
Good if we want to build a functional MVP first and iteratively add new features.

An MVP could consist of the three services
- front-end,
- pong server, and
- user management.

### User and Game Stats
Not MVP relevant and can be integrated as a service later.
