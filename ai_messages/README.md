Knowledge Distillation: As described in Sanh et al. (2019), “knowledge distillation is a compression technique in which a compact model – the student – is trained to reproduce the behavior of a larger model – the teacher – or an ensemble of models.” Also see Bucila et al. (2006) and Hinton et al. (2015).
